		<h1>1 June 2020</h1><hr>
		<p class="article-text">I realized today that I want to become a doctor. Not just any regular old doctor--a surgeon. I have lived my whole life being lazy and working to half of my potential, and I believe that I need a challenge in my life. To address this urge, I think that becoming a doctor will help me fulfill this urge to do something challenging, while also being able to help people out.<br><br>Throughout this whole coronavirus-quaratine experience, I have received a lot of change. Starting with my conviction to study harder to striving to be more fit, I am improving my life for the better. However, the greatest change of all has occurred today. My interests and aspirations for my future job have remained pretty stagnant over the years: majoring in computer science. This by far has been the greatest change in my way of thinking in probably my entire life. My reasons to become a doctor, as I mentioned above, was to challenge myself, and because I want to help people out. I mention the coronavirus situation because it has really opened my eyes to the lack of medical technology that we, as a human race, actually have. Of course revolutionary advancements such as the discovery of the cell, dna, and many years later, vaccines, and now a great advocacy for mental health--the possibilities in advancements in the medical field are endless. These possibilities fascinate me, and I want to leave a legacy as a person who worked hard and put his/her efforts into saving lives.<br><br>I read an article that said that many people experience dreams a lot more frequently than before quarantine started. The writer reasoned that it was probably due to people being “locked inside” their homes for so long that people are going crazy. I don’t know about that, maybe for the writer (obviously I’m joking, I’m not actually calling the writer crazy), but personally, I think I tend to have more dreams these days because of the newly found conviction to try harder that I have. My dreams include me attending lectures at Harvard, creating a new version of computers, and even giving a lecture at Yale. I hope I am not going crazy, and that these dreams are actually signs of my visions for the world.<br><br>In order to make my dream of becoming a doctor come true, I have to learn to schedule. Now that I have conviction to learn, I have found so much stuff to do... I can’t make the excuse of saying, “I don’t have anything to do.” However, since I don’t have a schedule, I am lost in where to start working. This may sound like a trivial obstacle, but it actually takes up a lot of my time trying to organize which topics to study, and where to finish. That is why I think I have to make and abide to a schedule. Having a schedule will remove, what I like to call (actually it’s a concept from a book by the writer Barry Schwartz) “the paradox of choice” for me. I will just have to abide by the schedule everyday, and I wouldn’t have to waste so much time deciding on which material to start on.<br><br>After I created a schedule, it led me to wonder, “What becomes of my passion for computer science?” I still love computers and programming, so I am sure that I am going to keep studying computers while pursuing my other dream. The world is changing, and soon, everyone is going to have to learn the fundamentals of computer science. In a sense, I am just getting a head start! I am sure that in the future, my computer science knowledge and my effort and pursuit in the field of biology will insterect. When that day comes, I am going to look back on these days and reflect on the choices that led to that moment. Anyways, even if I end up not using my computer science knowledge in the future, at least studying computers isn’t a harmful hobby.
