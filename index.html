		<p class="article-text">Hi, I'm Sam. I'm curious about a lot of stuff, and I felt that this was a great way to kind of let out my feelings concerning a multitude of topics--especially because my I don't want to hear my parents say, "Just Google it," again. Topics such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="article-text">Programming</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Operating Systems</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Networking</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Algorithms</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Economics</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Math</p></li>
			<li><p class="article-text">Psychology</p></li>		
			<li><p class="article-text">Biology</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="article-text">These are only some of the topics that interest me. The logo for the blog <i>whoami</i> is actually a reference to a common command in a linux kernel terminal emulator. The <i>whoami</i> outputs the user currently active in the terminal to the screen. To get a minimalistic and custom approach to blogging, I coded the entire website from scratch. Of course, I did use Bootstrap CSS for the navbar at the top of the page, but then again, that also took a big of customizing to match my preferences. On top of blogs about computer science, I also like to talk about the life of a student. I currently attend high school, and have lots to talk about the social hierarchies between the students, the faculty, and even sometimes between these two groups as well. I also discuss the difficulty of choice. We, as humans, make tons of choices everyday--but do we actually know why we make those choices. Follow me as I  dive into the world of economics, statistics, and much more!</p>
