		<h1>30 May 2020</h1><hr>
		<p class="article-text">I woke up at 9:00 A.M and tried to read my AP Chemistry textbook. After about twenty minutes, I couldn’t handle it. I remember my mom telling me that even if I couldn’t understand the text, I shouldn’t give up and keep rereading the material until I <i>do</i> understand it. I can now confidently say that it isn’t as easy as it sounds.<br><br>Past Saturday mornings, I would get up around 11:00. I would get up and just eat brunch and probably watch YouTube until around 3:00. After that, I would try to finish a lot of the weekend assignments that were assigned to me for that weekend. Because, as I stated in my last post, I have conviction and motivation to live a more disciplined life, I decided to get up early today. Overall, I do feel that I will improve if I keep pushing myself to wake up earlier (I know--9:00 A.M isn’t that early) and study during that time, I will truly reach my potential... but it’s just too dang hard.<br><br>I remember watching Itaewon Class, a Korean drama, and in the first episode, just a few minutes in, Jo Yi-Seo, a character, states that everyone knows how to be successful, it’s just that not everyone is willed and motivated enough to follow through. I think that in most cases that is true. Especially for me, I have plenty of resources available to me, but I choose to opt for the easy way out.<br><br>After my failure to read the textbook past thirty minutes, I was so discouraged. I wondered if I was actually just dumb, and that I had already reached my full potential. To block these negative thoughts, I decided to pay my dad a visit downstairs. He was working on fixing up the house.<br><br>Every Saturday morning, my dad wakes up early in the morning and looks for things to improve. Whether it be cleaning his working space, fixing household appliances, or just tidying up the house, he has always been up early with my mom to improve the quality of our family’s life.<br><br>Today, he was working on fixing our garbage can. I wondered if we even needed to go through the hassle of fixing a garbage can. I nonchalantly threw a comment at my dad, “Why can’t we just buy another garbage can?” He stopped what he was doing, and firmly told me that in order to improve, we have to find out what is wrong, and learn from our mistakes. He showed me what was wrong with the garbage can: the lid was hanging off the side because the hinges had broken. My dad explained that in everything that we do, little things like putting out the trash, or getting up early in the morning add up to big things. He explained that because we had been less careful in taking out the trash, we would have had to waste time to get another trash can. He finally explained to me that he didn’t need to fix the trash can. Of course he could have just as easily gone and bought a new trash can; however, to change oneself, one must first go through an uncomfortable period of change.<br><br>His words resonated deeply with me. I found myself ashamed of giving up on reading the textbook. I went upstairs and mediated on what he said. By that time, it was already 3:00. My family gathered in the living room to watch the SPACEX and NASA launch of the Demo-2 spaceship to the International Space Station. Watching the incredible launch, I felt more conviction and more motivation to try harder. After the launch was finished, I went back upstairs and decided to give reading my textbook another shot. This time, I would force myself to understand the information.<br><br>Even though I felt the same way I did as in morning, I pushed through and finally read a chapter. In conclusion, I actually did brush up on many of the topics that I had forgotten about as this year passed, and I am glad that I reaccustomed myself with those topics. Above all, I finished something. Reading a chapter out of the textbook is stuff that only nerds do, or so I thought. The road to self improvement is filled with discouragement and hardships, but in the end, it is all worth it. I still have a lot to learn, and there will be more discouragements down the way, but I have to push through those obstacles with undying conviction.</p>
