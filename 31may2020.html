		<h1>29 May 2020</h1><hr>
		<p class = "article-text">As I was attending a lecture at Harvard, Kanye West tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh..." There was once a time in my life that I actually enjoyed <i>Good Morning</i> by Kanye West. Nowadays, the song that I chose to make my morning alarm has gradually become the most painful sound I hear. I was instantly thrown onto my bed and felt the cool morning breeze blow on my nose. I had forgotten to close the window before going to sleep yesterday, and even though it was pretty much summer, my nose was in agony from the dry environment in my room caused by that mistake.<br><br>I got out of bed and drank a glass of water and completed my morning routine. By the time I had finished making my bed, eating breakfast, washing my face and brushing my teeth, it was still only 8:30. From 8:30 to 12:00 I read my AP Chemistry textbook. Enduring through the boredom, and fighting my eyelids from closing was pretty fun. FUN? Am I crazy? No, and here’s why: after I quit playing games, I really am so bored. I have nothing to do (that’s not true, I actually have plenty of stuff to do, just not “fun” stuff) so I read books and study. Today, learning about dissociation of molecules was actually pretty fun. Maybe it’s because I’m going crazy or something due to quarantine, but I actually feel like I am developing a fondness towards chemistry.<br><br>I have learned a lot about myself during this quarantine time, and I feel so grateful. Aside from academic improvements, I have also improved socially. I am quite thankful for these experiences. Of course, I feel very bad and feel sympathy for the thousands of people worldwide that are affected by the coronavirus, but in these times of suffering, I have truly matured significantly. For starters, I have grown to appreciate my family more. Through thick and thin, they are always there for me. I crave for real relationships, and have tried to garner/maintain the intimate relationships that I have with friends around me.<br><br>I think that through these relationships, I have learned to value honesty and improvement. Friends that I have made in the past were nice to me, and made me laugh; however, they would not tell me my flaws, and everything they said to me was just nice words. Of course it doesn’t hurt to have nice things said to you, but I realized that these relationships can end in a day. One screw up and they will leave me like rats abandoning a sinking ship. I still try to maintain a relationship with these people, but I stop myself from becoming too intimate with them.<br><br>With the friends that are intimate with me and truly care about me, I talk with them more and try to grow our relationships. I think that’s what a community is: a group of people that care for each other. Through simple networking and overcoming a few awkward moments, a lifelong relationship is made.<br><br>I bring up this whole spiel because today I caught up with a long time friend of mine, and I was able to have a long and intimate conversation with him. We had been apart for so long, so it was kind of awkward at first, but sharing all of the experiences we endured over the years broke through the barriers of awkwardness. I encourage everyone to ring up an old friend or acquaintance, and just strike up a conversation. Even if an intimate relationship isn’t made, at least you and the receiving person aren’t as distant as you were before (hopefully, of course).<br><br>So after I talked with my friend for about an hour, it was already time for dinner. Tonight, my mom made me 감자탕 (pork bone soup). It is one of my favorite dishes, because the pork bone stock mixed with crushed sesame seeds and kimchi create an amalgam of steamy goodness. The taste is incredible, and it is actually very healthy for you.<br><br>Anyways, after finishing the pork bone soup, I was faced with a choice: to go upstairs and probably watch netflix until it was time to sleep, or to go outside and run. I had stopped running recently (I stopped when I began to study for AP tests), and I really had to start running again. Since today was Sunday, and Sunday marks the beginning of the week, I mustered up all my energy and finally decided to run again.<br><br>Usually, I would run at 3:00. Today, I began my run at 8:00 P.M. The funny thing about running at night and in the dark is that you tend to run faster. After about the second lap, the sun had set completely, and only the weak light from the lampposts and the moon lit the way home. Throughout my run home, I would hear random bustling in bushes and branches snapping.<br><br>I kept convincing myself that there was no one out to get me, that there’s no use in even kidnappning me; but then I heard a scream. I ran home as fast as I could, which was a mile run, and when I finally arrived home, I looked behind me... there was no one there. <i>False alarm</i>. Now that I look back on it, it was probably a deer screaming. Thanks to the screech, I shaved thirty seconds off of my mile time...<br><br>Today was another step towards the right direction. Hopefully, I can keep this up and not tire out like I did the last time. Motivation is the only real obstacle, but I think I have got it under control this time. Signing off for tonight: good night!</p>
