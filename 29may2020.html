		<h1>29 May 2020</h1><hr>
		<p class = "article-text">Today, I started watching the Korean drama 미생 (Misaeng). It is about a character called Jang Geurae. From what I know right now, he used to be a genius Go (baduk) player. He had great potential, but he ended up not reaching it because his family was poor and his parents were sick. Because of this, Geurae had to work odd jobs and had no time to study Go. In essence, Geurae had wasted the first 26 years of his life. The first and second episode outline how much effort Geurae puts into his work.<br><br>I remember watching this drama a long time ago when it first came out in 2014. At that time, I was too young to understand what was going on. Coming back to it now, six years later, I finally understand why Misaeng is such a good drama. It is the perfect outline of “the real world”. It offers to show the difficulty in fitting into a workspace environment, and also the struggles to achieve greatness.<br><br>This drama, even though I have only watched the first two episodes, gives me conviction. It motivates me to work harder. After quarantine started, I began to run everyday, to train myself to fight against laziness. I wanted to teach myself to push past my difficulties to accomplish what I plan for myself. On top of that, I was getting up every morning one hour before school (yes, I know that it is virtual school right now) to read either the bible or a book. After about a month of doing so, I gave up. I gradually fell back into the same routine of losing focus of my goals and watching youtube, or procrastinating by watching shows on Netflix.<br><br>Thankfully, I came across Misaeng in my procrastination. I hope to keep the conviction that I felt after watching Misaeng, and hope to stop procrastinating. In the end, as Geurae states, all that matters is how much effort I put into my goals--I can’t blame others for not reaching my goal, it is my responsibility. Starting today, I will start my daily regimen of getting up early, and running everyday. No excuses. I will reach my goal, and if I don’t it is because I did not put in enough effort.</p>
